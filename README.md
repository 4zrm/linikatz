# linikatz

This repository contains all of the scripts and source code for "Where 2 Worlds Collide: Bringing Mimikatz et al to UNIX". In addition to the main linikatz.sh script, this also includes auditd policies, John the Ripper rules, Metasploit post-exploitation modules and fuzzers. The research behind this has now been incorporated into ATT&CK for Enterprise: T1558. More will follow in due course.

To use the linikatz tool:

* ```./linikatz.sh```
